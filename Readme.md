# Todo Demo â€“ **CIâ€‘first** Edition

Tiny fullâ€‘stack app (ReactÂ +Â Express) built to **showcase automated QA**.  
All tests run **inside Docker** and in GitHub Actions with one click.

---

## â‘ Â Run Locally (Docker Compose, <â€¯2â€¯min)

docker compose up --build --force-recreate

## â‘¡Â CI / CD

A readyâ€‘made workflow **.github/workflows/ci.yml** triggers on:

* `push` (any branch)  
* `pull_request`  
* manual **Run workflow** button

The job simply reâ€‘uses the compose file:

```yaml
- run: docker compose up --build --exit-code-from tester
```

âœ…  If *tester* exits with codeâ€¯0 the build passes; HTML & coverage
reports are uploaded as artifacts.

## â‘£Â Assumptions & Tradeâ€‘offs

* Inâ€‘memory DB keeps compose light.
